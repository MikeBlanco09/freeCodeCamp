## freeCodeCamp Certifications Projects

This repository contains all the projects required to earn freeCodeCamp certifications. Each directory within this repository corresponds to a specific certification and contains the projects needed to complete it.

## Usage

Feel free to reference the files in this repository if you need help with the certifications. They are here to guide you and provide examples of how to approach and solve the projects. However, I strongly recommend that you **do not copy these files as they are**.

The most important part of the learning process is to work through the challenges and projects on your own. By doing the work yourself, you will gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and skills needed to become a proficient developer.

## Repo Structure

Each certification has its own directory, and within each directory, you will find the projects associated with that certification.
